## PCA

- PCA is a statistical technique used for dimension reduction of data while keeping as much information as possible. PCA aims to reduce the number of variables in dataset while preserving as much information as possible from the original dataset.

- PCA transforms the original variables into a new set of variables, known as, principal components (or loadings), that are linear combination of the original variables.
